##### This isn't going to be a very long page, since it only holds 2 commands that are pretty self explainatory.

#### View FPKG version:
```
# fpkg -v
```
This command basically tells FPKG to print its version.

#### FPKG help dialogue:
```
# fpkg -a
```
This command basically just prints out a help dialogue, with its options and what they do. 
Think `-a` for "about"
